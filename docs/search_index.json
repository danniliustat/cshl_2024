GWAS Case Study-Continuous Trait 4.1 Data Preprocessing Here we introduce a hands-on practice of a case study on genome-wide association study with continuous traits. This breast cancer study of Polish Caucasion cohort aims to identify new CYP2D6 DNA variants associated with impaired metabolism of tamoxifen toward endoxifen, and can be used to predicting efficacy of tamoxifen treatment. In this notebook, we will use their preprocessed 192 DNA samples selected from the Polish Caucasian cohort to show you a typical GWAS workflow. The selection of these 192 samples is based on ratio of the sum of two tamoxifen active metabolite ((Z)-endoxifen and (Z)-4-OH-Tam) plasma concentrations to the sum of the concentrations of tamoxifen and the remaining measured compounds. As a result, 96 samples were from patients with the highest ratio, and 96 were from those with the lowest ratio. Please refer to the following paper if you are interested in details of this data. Reference paper: Hennig EE, Piatkowska M, Goryca K, Pospiech E, Paziewska A, Karczmarski J, Kluska A, Brewczynska E, Ostrowski J “Non-CYP2D6 variants selected by GWAS improved the prediction of impaired tamoxifen metabolism in breast cancer patients.” J Clin Med. 2019 Aug; 8(8): 1087. doi: 10.3390/jcm8081087 Important: Raw Whole Genome Sequencing data can be very large, more than 1Gb. We will show you the codes about how to download and preprocess the raw genotype data from start. But to run the analysis on laptop with limited memory, we provide the subsetted genotype data with only the first 1000 SNPs for you to practice. Special notes for Windows users: Windows has two command-line shells, Command shell and Windows Powershell. Command shell is specific to Windows system and can be run from RStudio Terminal or in “Command Prompt” App, but the language it uses is NOT the same as Bash! Powershell App is the only place to run Bash commands in Windows. Therefore if you are Windows users and use RStudio for this course, you can’t run bash codes such as “head” or “awk” from RStudio Terminal, you can ONLY run PLINK program codes. If you would like to try Bash codes, please open “Windows Powershell” app and follow the same steps to set the paths. Still, Powershell App won’t run PLINK codes, so you’ll have to switch between Powershell and RStudio Terminal.
