The procedures consist of four steps: Quality Control Imputation Population Stratification Correction Simple Association Test The data used for this example is a toy genotype data containing 5 random SNPs and a random phenotype data with covariates. We use both bash and R codes in this notebook. The type of programming language is labeled at the top of each code cell. Special notes for Windows users: Windows has two command-line shells, Command shell and Windows Powershell. Command shell is specific to Windows system and can be run from RStudio Terminal or in “Command Prompt” App, but the language it uses is NOT the same as Bash! Powershell App is the only place to run Bash commands in Windows. Therefore if you are Windows users and use RStudio for this course, you can’t run bash codes such as “head” or “awk” from RStudio Terminal, you can ONLY run PLINK program codes. If you would like to try Bash codes, please open “Windows Powershell” app and follow the same steps to set the paths. Still, Powershell App won’t run PLINK codes, so you’ll have to switch between Powershell and RStudio Terminal. 3.1 Environment Setting Before we can run any analysis, we need to set the working directory path to the downloaded “bigcare-main” folder for both Terminal and Console in RStudio. Below are the codes to setup paths at both places. These paths have to be setup correctly at first, otherwise we can’t locate the correct input files. # change the paths to where you saved &quot;bigcare-main&quot; ## run in Terminal mydir=&quot;/path/to/bigcare-main&quot; cd $mydir # R codes- run in R Console setwd(&quot;/path/to/bigcare-main&quot;) 3.2 GWAS Tools We will use two main program tools in this notebook, PLINK and IMPUTE2. PLINK is used for quality control and perform association test for large scale genotype data. You can download PLINK program using this link. Download the .zip file or find the .zip files suitable for your laptop system in “bigcare-main/Tools/PLINK” and unzip it to call the plink program in the folder. IMPUTE2 is used for genotype imputation and haplotype phasing. You can download its program using this link. IMPUTE2 program is only available to run in Linux or macOS system. You can find the zipped installation file in “bigcare-main/Tools/IMPUTE2”. If you want to perform imputation for your own data, you also need to download the required reference genome from the above link. But in this notebook will only use the example genome. Important: If you want to run these two programs on your laptop, please make sure you have unzipped the installation packages in “./bigcare-main/Tools” that is suitable for your laptop systerm. We will directly call PLINK and IMPUTE2 programs using relative path. Instructions on installing these two tools can be found on course GitHub here. For example, my computer is macOS system so I can run both PLINK and IMPUTE2. After I downloaded “bigcare-main” folder, I open ./Tools/PLINK and unzip the plink package for macOS: “plink_mac_20230116.zip”. A folder “plink_mac_20230116” will be created which contains a program file called “plink”. Then, I can call PLINK program by specifying the absolute path of this “plink” program: /path/to/bigcare-main/Tools/PLINK/plink_mac_20230116/plink. Similar for Windows system, you need to unzip the package “plink_win64_20230116.zip” with right click-&gt;“Extract All…”. Then you can call PLINK with /path/to/bigcare-main/Tools/PLINK/plink_win64_20230116/plink.exe. Similar for IMPUTE2, I unzip “impute_v2.3.2_MacOSX_Intel.tgz” for macOS under “./bigcare-main/Tools/IMPUTE2/”. And I can call IMPUTE2 program with /path/to/bigcare-main/Tools/IMPUTE2/impute_v2.3.2_MacOSX_Intel/impute2. Note that Windows system won’t be able to run IMPUTE2. You should modify the above /path/to/bigcare to where your “bigcare-main” folder is. However, macOS users need to go through additional steps to authorize PLINK and IMPUTE2 programs before you can call them! See below. When you try to call PLINK or IMPUTE2 with the above commands, you might get a pop-up window with the following message “plink” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.. Select “Cancel” and we will authorize PLINK first. Please go to macOS “System Settings”-&gt;“Privacy &amp; Security”, and scroll down until you see a message “plink” was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.. Click “Allow Anyway” and you will be prompt to enter your Mac username and password. Click “Unlock” and then “Allow Anyway” again, and the previous message will disappear. Then try to run the same codes again in RStudio Terminal. You will get another pop-up window saying macOS cannot verify the developer of “plink”. Are you sure you want to open it?, select “Open” then you can see PLINK or IMPUTE2 commands options show up in Terminal. 3.3 Quality Control PLINK will generate a number of standard summary statistics that are useful for quality control (e.g. missing genotype rate, minor allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and non-Mendelian transmission rate). These can also be used as thresholds for subsequent analyses. For more detailed information about plink, please refer its website http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/. The following is a list of some common options that can be used to filter out individuals or SNPs on the basis of the summary statistic measures: Feature inclusion criteria As summary statistic As inclusion criteria Missingness per individual --missing --mind N. Missingness per marker –missing –geno N Allele frequency –freq –maf N Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium –hardy –hwe N 3.4 An Example of Summary Statistics 3.4.1 Input files Input files: in folder ./QC– We will use a random selected 5 SNPs as an example data: 5SNPs.ped 5SNPs.map The PED file is a white-space delimited file: the first six columns are mandatory: Family ID Individual ID Paternal ID Maternal ID Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown) Phenotype # bash codes- run in Terminal # Windows user need to run in Powershell App head ./Data/QC/5SNPs.ped ## 1 206-001 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 2 206-003 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 3 206-004 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 4 206-014 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 5 206-015 0 0 1 0 A G A G A G A G A A ## 6 206-016 0 0 1 0 A G A G A G A G A A ## 7 206-018 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 8 206-019 0 0 1 0 A A A G A G A G A G ## 9 206-021 0 0 1 0 A A G G G G G G A A ## 10 206-023 0 0 1 0 A G A G A G A G A A By default, each line of the MAP file describes a single marker and must contain exactly 4 columns: chromosome (1-22, X, Y or 0 if unplaced) rs# or snp identifier Genetic distance (morgans) Base-pair position (bp units) head ./Data/QC/5SNPs.map ## 1 rs3094315 0 752566 ## 1 rs2073813 0 753541 ## 1 rs3131969 0 754182 ## 1 rs3131967 0 754334 ## 1 rs77598327 0 757120 Three types of summary statistics that we are going to calculate using PLINK: missingness checking allele frequencies hardy-weinberg All results generated from the following commands are saved in folder ./Data/QC. You can open the files in this folder to view the data structure. 3.4.2 Calculating missing rate The following commands compute the missingness for each SNP and each subject. (The output will print all calculation progress generated by PLINK.) –noweb, suppress the connection to internet for version check. –file, specify the input files. –missing, calculate the number of missing and missing rate. –out, specify the output file name. # both Mac and Windows can run in Terminal # modify the path to &quot;plink&quot; program # for macoS users ./Tools/PLINK/plink_mac_20230116/plink \\ --noweb --file ./Data/QC/5SNPs --missing --out ./Data/QC/younameit # for windows users ./Tools/PLINK/plink_win64_20230116/plink.exe \\ --noweb --file ./Data/QC/5SNPs --missing --out ./Data/QC/younameit This option creates two output files in ‘results’ folder: “younameit.imiss”, missingness by individual. “younameit.lmiss”, missingness by SNP. For individuals “.imiss” file, the format is: FID Family ID IID Individual ID MISS_PHENO Missing phenotype? (Y/N) N_MISS Number of missing SNPs N_GENO Number of non-obligatory missing genotypes F_MISS Proportion of missing SNPs # bash codes- run in Terminal # Windows user need to run in Powershell App head ./Data/QC/younameit.imiss ## FID IID MISS_PHENO N_MISS N_GENO F_MISS ## 1 206-001 Y 0 5 0 ## 2 206-003 Y 0 5 0 ## 3 206-004 Y 0 5 0 ## 4 206-014 Y 0 5 0 ## 5 206-015 Y 0 5 0 ## 6 206-016 Y 0 5 0 ## 7 206-018 Y 0 5 0 ## 8 206-019 Y 0 5 0 ## 9 206-021 Y 0 5 0 For SNP “lmiss” file, the format is: SNP SNP identifier CHR Chromosome number N_MISS Number of individuals missing this SNP N_GENO Number of non-obligatory missing genotypes F_MISS Proportion of sample missing for this SNP # bash codes- run in terminal # Windows user need to run in Powershell App head ./Data/QC/younameit.lmiss ## CHR SNP N_MISS N_GENO F_MISS ## 1 rs3094315 2 344 0.005814 ## 1 rs2073813 14 344 0.0407 ## 1 rs3131969 11 344 0.03198 ## 1 rs3131967 3 344 0.008721 ## 1 rs77598327 10 344 0.02907 3.4.3 Calculating allel frequencies The following command computes the allele frequencies. (The output will print all calculation progress generated by PLINK.) 1. –freq, calculate the allele frequencies. # both Mac and Windows can run in Terminal # modify the path to &quot;plink&quot; program # macOS user ./Tools/PLINK/plink_mac_20230116/plink \\ --noweb --file ./Data/QC/5SNPs --freq --out ./Data/QC/younameit # Windows user ./Tools/PLINK/plink_win64_20230116/plink.exe \\ --noweb --file ./Data/QC/5SNPs --freq --out ./Data/QC/younameit This command will create a output file “younameit.frq” with six columns: CHR Chromosome SNP SNP identifier A1 Allele 1 code (minor allele) A2 Allele 2 code (major allele) MAF Minor allele frequency NCHROBS Non-missing allele count # bash codes- run in terminal # Windows user need to run in Powershell App head ./Data/QC/younameit.frq ## CHR SNP A1 A2 MAF NCHROBS ## 1 rs3094315 G A 0.07749 684 ## 1 rs2073813 A G 0.2242 660 ## 1 rs3131969 A G 0.2387 666 ## 1 rs3131967 A G 0.2082 682 ## 1 rs77598327 G A 0.1228 668 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
